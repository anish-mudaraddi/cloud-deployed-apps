# ChatOps

> WIP: To be completed before promotion to production.

Deploys an ArgoCD managed Cloud ChatOps instance. This deployment configuration piggybacks of the Kubernetes deployment defined in the [project repo docs](https://github.com/stfc/cloud-docker-images/blob/master/cloud-chatops/INSTALL.md).
